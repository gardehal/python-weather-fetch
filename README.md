# python-simple-weather-fetch

A simple python program that fetches data from [MET Weather API](https://api.met.no/weatherapi) and returns current temp, temp for rest of the day, and temp for next 24 hours.

## Usage (Windows)
1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Make sure Python is defined on PATH
3. Navigate to folder in CLI
4. $python weather.py

Optional: [Define coordinates](https://www.latlong.net) for costum location

## Possible additions:
- Might add more detailed info, max/min predicted temp, tomorrow instead fo next 24 etc
- Option to add custom lat/lon (Getting coords from place name posibble though Google API, but is overkill)
